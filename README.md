# Magnetic_Field_Pulse_Generator

## About the project
This project entails the development of the power system of a novel medical device to inhibit preterm uterine contractions using a magnetic field pulse. Premature birth and attendant complications are the main cause of neonatal death and mortality and a major cause of maternal complications from preterm labor. It is among the greatest health problems in the world. Inhibiting preterm uterine contractions and eventually preterm birth is still an unsolved major problem for medicine and society with costs more than 25 billion dollars per year in the United States alone.

*Prototype Power System of a Magnetic Preterm Uterine Inhibitor*
<div align="left"> 

To achieve this effect, a high-frequency switching power supply is required to provide pulsed current at low voltage (around 3.1 Volts) and high current (3 Amps). So, out of some very brilliant contenders, I ended up moving forward with Allegro A6211 IC.

*A6211 Typical Application Circuit*
<div align="left"> 

The A6211 is a single IC switching regulator that provides constant-current output to drive high-power LEDs. It integrates a high-side N-channel DMOS switch for DC-to-DC step- down (buck) conversion. A true average current is output using a cycle-by-cycle, controlled on-time method.
 
* Supply voltage 6 to 48 V
* True average output current control
* 3 A maximum output over operating temperature range
* Cycle-by-cycle current limit
* Integrated MOSFET switch
* Dimming via direct logic input or power supply voltage
* Internal control loop compensation
* Undervoltage lockout (UVLO) and thermal shutdown protection
* Low power shutdown (1 μA typical)
* Robust protection against:
	--Adjacent pin-to-pin short
	--Pin-to-GND short
	--Component open/short faults

*Buck Converter Circuit and it's states during switching*
<div align="left"> 

The A6211 operates in fixed on-time mode during switching. The on-time (and hence switching frequency) is programmed using an external resistor connected between the VIN and TON pins, as given by the following equation:

*tON = k × (RON + RINT) × (VOUT / VIN)*

*fSW = 1 / [ k × (RON + RINT)]*
Where k = 0.0139, with fSW in MHz, tON in μs, and RON and
RINT (internal resistance, 5 kΩ) in kΩ (see the figure below).

## Considering IC LT8613
This was the Second best contender to drive the switching circuit and the following data was obtained from running the simulations. The parallel application allowed to obtain a high amount of current was an added flexibility along with many safety features. 
The LT8613 is a compact, high efficiency, and high speed synchronous monolithic step-down switching regulator. The integrated power switches and inclusion of all necessary circuitry reduce the components count and solution size. Ultralow 3μA quiescent current in Burst Mode® operation achieves high efficiency at very light loads. Fast minimum on-time of 40ns enables high VIN to low VOUT conversion at high frequency.

## Results Obtained

The following waveform was supposed to generate for the system designed. A snapshot was taken from the A6211 Datasheet depicting wave behavior without and with a capacitor. Although this is not the ultimate goal of the project, we can use this comparison metric to determine the degree of accuracy achieved.
